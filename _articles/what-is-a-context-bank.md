# What is a context bank?

Your AI assistant is brilliant but clueless about your business.

It can write code, analyze data, and draft emails. But it doesn't know your approval thresholds, your naming conventions, or why that one client always gets special treatment.

A **context bank** fixes this.

## The knowledge gap

Every company has operational knowledge that lives in:

- People's heads
- Scattered documents nobody reads
- "That's just how we do it" conversations
- Exceptions to the exceptions

This knowledge is proprietary, messy, and mostly undocumented. No AI model — no matter how smart — can access it without help.

## What goes in a context bank

Think of it as a structured knowledge repository with three types of content:

**Work processes** — How things actually get done. Not the official SOP, but the real workflow including who does what and when to escalate.

**Business rules** — Decision logic, thresholds, and exceptions. "Discounts over 20% need manager approval, unless it's a strategic account."

**Terminology** — What words mean in your context. "Active customer" might mean different things to sales and finance.

## Why "bank"?

The metaphor matters:

- **Deposits**: Domain experts add knowledge
- **Withdrawals**: AI retrieves context when needed
- **Interest**: Knowledge compounds as connections emerge
- **Audit trail**: You see what changed and why

## The bridge concept

Current tools serve one audience. SharePoint and Notion are for humans. Prompts and fine-tuning are for AI.

A context bank serves both. Same source of truth, two consumers. Humans maintain it. AI retrieves from it. Everyone works from the same map.

## Getting started

You don't need fancy infrastructure to start. Begin with:

1. Pick one process your team does repeatedly
2. Document it in a structured format (we use YAML + Markdown)
3. Include the exceptions and judgment calls
4. Test: can a new hire AND an AI understand it?

The goal isn't perfection. It's making implicit knowledge explicit — one process at a time.
