# Context bank

A structured knowledge repository for humans and AI.

## Articles

- [What is a context bank?](/articles/what-is-a-context-bank) — The core concept explained
- [How to structure context documents](/articles/structuring-context-documents) — Practical formatting guide

## The idea in 30 seconds

AI is smart but doesn't know your business. A context bank captures operational knowledge — processes, rules, terminology — in a format both humans can maintain and AI can consume.

Same source of truth. Two audiences. One bridge.

## This is a prototype

We're testing whether [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/) + GitHub Pages works as a lightweight context bank. The goal: validate the content model before building retrieval infrastructure.
